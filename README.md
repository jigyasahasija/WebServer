# WebServer

A basic HTTP server developed in Python that can handle concurrent multiple client requests.

The following steps were followed:
Step 1: Create a socket and binding it with the host server to enable it to listen for connections and return an appropriate response
Step 2: Code was tweaked to return an HTML page on request
Step 3: Code was changed to include the support for concurrent client requests. This has been done using traditional Multithreading in python.
